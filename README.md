# ME433-Advanced-Mechatronics
This is a course repo for ME 433 Advanced Mechatronics at Northwestern. In this class, I build a mobile robot that's controlled by an Android phone to follow a colored line. 

I use the camera of the phone to track the line and I use a PIC32 microcontroller to control the motor. The phone and the PIC32 communicates via USB. 

The final java code for the android phone is in TechCupAndroid folder while the final C code for the PIC32 is in the TechCupPIC folder. 

I laser cut and 3D printed all the mounting fixture (including suspension and wheels). 

See below as the final demonstration.
